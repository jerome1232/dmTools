        <li>
          Loot Generator - Generate randomized treasure for your players based on encounter difficulty. You can choose to generate treasure based on individual monsters or for a hoard's cache. Loot generation is entirely based on loot tables found in the DMG.

      </ul>
      Current plans are to add:
      <ul>
        <li>
